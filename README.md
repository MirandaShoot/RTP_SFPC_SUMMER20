# RTP_SFPC_SUMMER20
recreating the past / SFPC summer 2020

Each week, we take a look at a different famous media artworks that have been made in code (or computationally driven) and recreate them from scratch, discussing the algorithmic approaches and tools, as well as poetic underpinnings. By re-creating these works, we can investigate also what modern tools and approaches have to offer. We will also look at broader examples about what the artwork teaches us about code and algorithmic approaches. For example, seminal works like Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv's "Text Rain" can be used as a starting point for discussing computer vision based interaction. The class takes inspiration from the re:code project.  Here's a general break down of the artists we will study

- Chaos and Order (Vera Molnar)
- Animation and Harmony (John Whitney)
- Computational Typography (Muriel Cooper / John Maeda)
- Pattern (Bridgette Riley / Anni Albers)
- Pixels (Ken Knowlton / Lillian F. Schwartz)
- Images (Nancy Burson / Jason Salavon)
- Body (Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv / Myron Krueger)
- Glitch / Deformation (Rosa Menkman / Steina and Woody Vasulka)
